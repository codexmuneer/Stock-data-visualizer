# Stock-data-visualizer
I had built an visualizer for visualizing Stocks of different banks using python matplotlib.
This program will visualize following data:
• Visualize the total turnover of stock being traded each day for all companies using
subplots.
• Visualize the daily price change in stock.
• Plot the monthly and yearly mean of close price.
• Plot the Daily Returns.
• What dates each bank stock had the best and worst single day returns. Just Display those
dates.
• Which bank stock would you classify as the riskiest over the entire time period? Make the bar chart for it.
• Make a line plot showing the Close price for each bank for the entire time in a single
graph
• Make another 3 interesting visualizations on this stock data and write down your findings
in markdown.
